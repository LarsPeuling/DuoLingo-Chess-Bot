## Flow
After you completed step 5,6,7,
This is what the bot will do in order:
1. search for "Games"
2. Click "Start Game"
3. Win or Lose games (First lose 50 games then win 30 games)
4. Press "Continue" until you are at the main screen.
5. Loop untill you have lost 50 games and won 30 games.
---
## Manipulate games
You can choose to manipulate the games you play. Here is how ->
1. Go to chess_daily.txt
-> To only win games:
2. Change the "losses" counter to 50
3. Enter the amount of games you want to win
i.e: you want to win 50 games -> "wins" : -20
Because -20 + 50 = 30.
If you want to win more games that 50, you should do: 
30 - (amount of games to win) = input wins

-> To only lose games:
2. Change the "wins" counter to 30
3. Enter the amount of games you want to lose
i.e: you want to lose 100 games -> "losses" : -50
Because -50 + 100 = 50
If you wan to lose more games than 100, you should do:
50 - amount of games you want to lose = input lose

-> both
4. Watch and enjoy

## Note
This was my first time using pyautogui, .npz template files, cv2, stockfish, tkinter
It is not optimized to get the most xp, to play the most games or to get the highest elo in DuoLingo Chess.
The bot was tested on Google Chrome
